 	<h5>WHAT IS A CAT CAFE?</h5>
 	<p>
	Cat Cafes are commonplace in Japan and became trendy in the US, first in LA. Guests come for coffee, tea and light bites surrounded by the energy of shelter cats. Guests can enjoy the cafe without interaction or can choose to donate $20 for an hour of cat interaction. Some come looking for a new BFF while others find it theraupetic and relaxing.<br>
	<br>
 	<h5>HOW OUR ADOPTION PROCESS WORKS</h5>
 	<p>
		We partner with local rescue agencies who do not have their own spaces. Our goal is provide an alternative to online and foster only options and allow guests to view cats in an engaging environment.<br>
		<br>
		Potential adopters must be over 18 and must complete a short survey so adoption counselors can make sure we understand your home environment and make sure the selected cat is the right fit for everyone in the home (human and otherwise). We also require a NY State ID, proof of residence (lease agreement, bill with current address, etc.) and confirmation that your landlord allows pets.<br>
		<br>
		You will then spend about an hour with an adoption counselor reviewing medical records and any information we have as to backgound or past homes as well as observations my staff and volunteers. We will discuss nutrition, ongoing care and socialization. Our goal is to create a PURRfect match and a FURRever home.</p>

	<h5>MEET FINNEGAN (AKA FINNI)</h5>

 	<p>
	When I became a cat care volunteer, I'd incorrectly assumed them to be aloof and disinterested but like many of us, they've just been through something and need to feel loved and safe before opening up. A year later after getting to know many cats, I met this handsome, orange polydactal cat. He immediately came to greet me and by the time my shift was over he was in a carrier on his way to his new home which is shared with two rescue dogs, Gerta and Oliver.<br>
	<br>
	Finni quickly acclimated to our home. Making friends with his canine brother and sister. He has taught us not to sweat the small stuff and embrace silliness and imperfection. He has enriched our lives and I am so grateful that he has honored me by allowing me to be his person. My goal is to create a space where I can share this joy with others while helping decrease the homeless cat population.
