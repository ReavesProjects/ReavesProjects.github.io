 	<h5>ABOUT SHARON</h5><h6>Owner. Founder. Design Geek.</h6>	
 	<p>
	My friends used to joke that I started companies as an excuse to design new websites. Perhaps it was true as one of the happiest memories from my time as a gallery owner was waking up at 3am with an idea for a new exhibit. I'd rush to grab my laptop and draft out concepts on my website to see how works of art looked together.<br>
	<br>
	I'm the person you mention in passing that you have an idea and the next morning I suprise you with a new site. God help my dentist or any site I might visit as I insist I can do it better. This is when I knew - perhaps I always knew - it was content and not art that I was meant to curate.
